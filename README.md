# Spatial Network Analysis of Walkability

## Overview

This repository contains code for spatial network analysis of walkability.  The `SpatialNetwork` library provides functionality for downloading network data 
from OpenStreetMap and analysis methods such as shortest path calculation, redundant path calculation, and route optimization.  

## Notebooks

Notebooks are provided to demonstrate use cases.

### Basic Functionality

This notebook demonstrates basic functions such as downloading road network data, working with catchment areas, and calculating paths between endpoints:
